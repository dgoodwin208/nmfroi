#NMF-based segmentation for Voltage Imaging Dataset

As seen in Piatkevich et al 2017 (link coming)

#Requirements:
NMFTool

#Acknowledgments
The concept of using rank-2 NMF on the power spectral density was created by Dan Goodwin and Eftychios Pnevmatakis. The load3Dtif_uint16() code is a slight modification the CaImAn [link] repository I/O functions.
